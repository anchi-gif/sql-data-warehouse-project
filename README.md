# sql-data-warehouse-project
Building a modern warehouse with MySQL, including ETL process, data modeling, and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implimentation of a modern warehouse and analytics solution using **MySQL**.

The project is inspired by the *Data with Baraa* SQL-based course and has been **adapted to MySQL**, with adjustments to SQL syntax and tooling.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
This project is structured into two main phases:

1. **Data Warehouse Development**
   - Ingesting raw data from CSV files
   - Performing data cleaning and transformation
   - Designing and implementing a dimensional data model (fact and dimension tables)

2. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Writing analytical SQL queries
   - Generating insights from the data warehouse

An architecture diagram was designed during the planning phase to clearly define data flow and  system components.

## 🔄️ ETL Process
The ETL workflow follows these steps:

- **Extract**: Load raw data from CSV files
- **Transformation**: Clean, normalize, and prepare data for analysis
- **Load**: Store transformation data into MySQL-based data warehouse

---

## 🏗️ Data Modeling
The data warehouse is modeled using **dimensional modeling techniques**, including:

- Fact tables for measurable business metrics
- Dimension tables for descriptive attributes
- Optimized schema design for analytical queries

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL** (Relational Database)
- **MySQL Workbench** (Database Management Tool)
- **CSV Files** (Source Data)
- **GitHub** (Version Control)
- **Draw.io** (Architecture & Data Modeling Diagrams)
